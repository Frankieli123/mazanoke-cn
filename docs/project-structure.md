## Basic App Flow

To better understand the appâ€™s flow and file interactions, the outline below describes the general image optimization process.

1. `index.html` launches the app.
1. The scripts are loaded in a specific order to initialize global variables, references, and dependencies that other scripts depend on.
    1. `vendor` scripts.
    1. `global.js`
    1. `utilities.js`
    1. `helpers.js`
    1. `ui.js`
    1. `compression.js`
    1. `download.js`
    1. `events.js`
1. `initApp()` in `events.js` binds events to interactive components in `index.html` and handles saving/restoring app settings.
1. When a user drops or selects an image, event handlers in `events.js` capture the input and trigger compression functions from `compression.js`.
1. Before compressing any images, `ui.js` parses and validates the selected options. To do so, many features from `utilities.js` are used to build the `options` object that are passed to the image compressor.
1. Input images go through `preProcessImage(file)` in `compression.js` to be decoded, ensuring compatibility with `browser-image-compression.js`, which serves as the main image compressor library in this app.
    - Image formats natively supported by browsers (JPG, PNG, WebP) typically don't need pre-processing and are passed through directly.
    - HEIC images are pre-processed, as they are not natively supported by major browsers.
    - AVIF is natively supported, but due to its already optimized nature, it is pre-processed to a lossy format to reduce the chance of the output file being larger than the original.
1. The state of the image processing, such as `isCompressing`, `compressQueue`, and more, are stored in `global.js`.
1. Once an image is processed, `handleCompressionResult(file, output)` in `helpers.js` outputs the compressed image on the user interface, where users can download individual images or all images as a zip, handled by `download.js`.
